Magic: The Gathering - Sealed Simulator
===================
A program to simulate opening six packs of Magic: The Gathering for purposes of practicing building a sealed deck.

Planned Features
===================
* Choose packs for sealed
* Generate and open the chosen packs
* Print sealed pool to file for easy proxies
* Potential Long Term Features:
  * Draft simulation

Planned Steps
===================
1. Version 1:
  * Full functionality for opening packs and displaying a list of the pulled cards
2. Version 1.5:
  * Handling of foils, special-case-rarities (time-shifted, flip, etc...)
3. Version 2:
  * Simpler display for more interactive and intuitive use
4. Version 2.5:
  * Write results to .doc or .pdf for more detailed proxies
5. Version 3.0 (far future):
  * Draft simulation
  * Networked connection to draft with other users
6. Version 3.5:
  * Cube Draft based on provided list of cards
Please Note: The start of this project is being done for a class, and as a result these steps may change as I learn more of the tools I will be using
